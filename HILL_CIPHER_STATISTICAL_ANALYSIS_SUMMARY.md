- Matrix operations with modular arithmetic (mod 26)
- Key validation and invertibility checking
- Text processing and padding handling

### 2. Statistical Analyzer (`hill_cipher/breakers/statistical_analyzer.py`)
- N-gram frequency analysis using Portuguese language statistics
- Chi-squared test for frequency comparison
- Bhattacharyya distance for distribution comparison

- **Optimized search strategies for larger keys** (3x3, 4x4, 5x5)
- Multiple generation strategies: smart random, frequency-based, pattern-based
- Adaptive parameters based on key size

### 4. Known Plaintext Attack (`hill_cipher/breakers/kpa.py`)
- Efficient KPA implementation for validation
- Matrix equation solving: C = P × K → K = P⁻¹ × C
- Multiple starting position testing for robustness

### 5. Enhanced Breaker (`hill_cipher/breakers/enhanced_breaker.py`)
- Unified interface combining all attack methods
- Automatic method selection based on available information
- Batch processing capabilities
- Comprehensive result validation

## Usage Examples

### 1. Crack 2x2 Hill Cipher
```python
from hill_cipher.breakers.improved_statistical_analyzer import ImprovedStatisticalAnalyzer

analyzer = ImprovedStatisticalAnalyzer(key_size=2)
key, decrypted, score = analyzer.break_cipher_improved(ciphertext)
```

### 2. Validate with Known Plaintext
```python
success = analyzer.validate_with_known_plaintext(ciphertext, known_plaintext)
```

### 3. Use Enhanced Breaker (Auto-method selection)
```python
from hill_cipher.breakers.enhanced_breaker import EnhancedHillBreaker

breaker = EnhancedHillBreaker(key_size=2)
results = breaker.break_cipher(ciphertext, known_plaintext=plaintext, method='auto')
```
